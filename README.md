## System Screenshots
> The character sheet has a clickable monitor experience! If you click on the coloured boxes, you get that much damage, and when you click on a white box you get healed unto that box. Stun overflow goes to Physical, and Physical into your Overflow. _In simple terms, don't get fragged._
